# Technical Report: AI Assistant Integration System

## System Architecture

The AI Assistant Integration System is built using a modular, component-based architecture that allows for flexibility and extensibility. This document provides a detailed technical overview of the system.

### Core Components

#### Request Router (`controller/router.py`)

The Request Router serves as the central hub of the system, orchestrating the flow of requests to appropriate components:

- Receives user queries and context
- Uses the Task Classifier to determine intent
- Routes requests to specialized components
- Maintains conversation context and history
- Integrates responses from different components

#### Task Classifier (`controller/task_classifier.py`)

The Task Classifier determines which component should handle a user query:

- Uses LLM-based classification to analyze user intent
- Extracts parameters needed for specific tasks
- Supports multiple task categories including conversational, document QA, image generation, and agent-based tasks

### Specialized Components

#### Conversation Memory (`memory/conversation.py`)

Manages conversation history and context:

- Stores user interactions and system responses
- Provides context for future interactions
- Supports persistent storage through file system

#### Document QA (`document_qa/qa_generator.py`)

Handles document-based question answering:

- Indexes documents for efficient retrieval
- Uses semantic search to find relevant document sections
- Generates answers based on document content
- Provides citations and sources for answers

#### Image Generator (`image_gen/generator.py`)

Creates AI-generated images based on user queries:

- Uses enhanced prompting to improve image quality
- Leverages OpenAI's DALL-E API
- Saves generated images to local storage
- Returns image metadata and URLs

#### Agent Coordinator (`agents/coordinator.py`)

Manages specialized agents for specific tasks:

- **Weather Agent**: Provides weather information for locations
- **Event Recommender**: Suggests events based on location and preferences
- **SQL Agent**: Executes and explains SQL queries

### Data Flow

1. User submits a query through `main.py`
2. The RequestRouter receives the query and uses TaskClassifier to determine intent
3. Based on classification, the request is routed to the appropriate component
4. The component processes the request and returns a response
5. The RequestRouter formats and returns the final response
6. Conversation history is updated
